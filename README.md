To-Do List App UI - Flutter 📝
A sleek and professional To-Do List application built with Flutter, focusing on clean UI/UX and a scalable architecture.

🎯 Task Objective
The goal was to design a functional and visually appealing two-screen layout:

Home Screen: Displays tasks in a stylized list using Cards.

Add Task Screen: A dedicated interface for entering new tasks.

✨ Design & Technical Features
Modern Color Palette: Used a "Deep Purple & Lavender" theme to create a calm and productive environment.

Clean Architecture Structure: Organized the project into features (home, add_task) with clear separation between layers (data, domain, presentation).

Responsive Card UI: Tasks are presented in elevated Cards with visual indicators for a premium look.

Smooth Navigation: Seamless transitions between the task list and the input screen.

User-Centric Input: Enhanced text fields with icons and focused borders for better usability.

🛠️ Architecture Overview
The project follows a modular structure for better maintainability:

lib/
└── features/
    ├── home/       # Task display logic & UI
    └── add_task/   # Task creation interface
